     <p class="smallHeader">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</p></p>
     
     In 1943 a man named Abraham Maslow made a theory in psychology in his paper "A theory of Human Motivation". He illustrated a pyramid scheme, a hierarchy, in which he splits motivation in 5 levels of needs.
     <ul> from bottom to top:
        <li>Physiological</li>
        <li>Safety</li>
        <li>Love/Belonging</li>
        <li>Esteem</li>
        <li>Self-actualization</li>
        </ul>
     
        You can split these 5 in 3 other categories. Physiological and Safety are basic needs. Love/Belonging and Esteem are psychological needs and Self-actualization are self-fullfilment needs.
        For me basic needs aren't applicable to the extend that I should be motivated by them to complete my study as they are focussed on surival and safety of me as a being by providing food and shelter.
        psychological needs are applicable. I am mostly motivated by accomplishment and responsibility, I can say I don't care about what people think of me on a personal level, but I care about what people think
        of me as a person. So what I accomplished and what I am doing in my everyday life. So reputation is important for me too and motivates me to make sure I do the things I have to do.
        self-fullfilment is what I think is what everyone is striving for and this theory places it as the highest possible achievement in the form of motivation. I want to feel that I did everything I could and am 
        my best self, and I know that I am not that at this moment but I want to be that person in my life, because what is the point if you can't get everything out of yourself in your life?

        Conclusion: I agree with this theory.
        <p class="smallHeader">Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory</p>
        The Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory also called the Two-factor theory is a theory developed by psychologist Frederick Herzberg.
        The theory came after a study of 200 engineers and accountants who got asked questions on their experience on the workfloor and previous experiences and how they got influenced by them.
        Herzberg concluded that there are 2 factors that influenced the workfloor experience. The first one is the maintenance or hygiene factor. Things that are not nececarilly part of the job but are related to 
        the job's conditions. Things like workfloor policies, administration, security, relationship with their colleagues, supervisors, salary and personal life.
        The second factor is the motivational factor. these factors motivate the person. Things like achievement, recognition, advancement, possibility of growth and responsibility. 
        This theory shows that there are more factors that are independent from each other but affect the person's motivation in a work environment. Which if we look at my study apply as well, if I don't make any
        friends during my study then I won't enjoy going to school that much. If I have alot of friends during my study then I would be more motivated to go to school and attend class because my friends are there 
        as well and makes me more motivated to learn and stay in the study.

        Conclusion: I agree with this theory.
       
        <p class="smallHeader">Vroom's Expectancy Theory</p>
        Vroom’s Expectancy Theory developed by Victor. H. Vroom believed that people are motivated to perform activities to achieve a goal with the expectancy that these actions will help them achieve their goal.
        Vroom assumed that a person makes a decision out of the choises he has to make him accomplish his goal. To make it really simple, a person wants to write something down on a piece of paper. To get to that
        goal the person needs to get a piece of paper first and then get a pencil to write on it, but what are you gonna take first? the pencil or the paper? One values either the paper or the pencil over the other.
        This example has one goal with only 2 instruments to achieve that goal alongside the motivation to write something down. If the pencil is really hard to find then the person can give up on looking and won't
        get the paper either because the person doesn't need it anymore. So the person's motivation of writing on a piece of paper got ruined by the person not finding the pencil. If the person found both the pencil and
        the paper and wrote something down but isn't satisfied by the action the person expected too much from the goal that the person achieved and won't do it another time because the person didn't get satisfied. 
        Expectancy refers to the person's motivation that the person had by expecting the goal to fulfill the person's needs.
        To get back to me and my study, my goal is to complete this study. I don't know exactly what road I will take in the study so I can be influenced by the results of particular tests/ homework. If I don't like doing
        a certain task or I find it very hard to accomplish a satisfying end result then I most likely won't go down that road to achieve my goal of completing the study. If my goal is to become a software engineer and have
        a really hard time along the way I won't be motivated enough to achieve that goal of being a software engineer and can't get to the point of comparing my expectancy of the beginning of the road towards that goal or
        the moment I achieved that goal. Which can be motivation on it's own, to see if what I expected was true.
        
        Conclusion: I agree with this theory, but it is such a multiple factor theory that it's hard to relate to.

        <p class="smallHeader">Dan Pink's view on motivation</p>
        Dan Pink claims that intrinsic motivation works better than extrinsic motivation. He calls upon multiple studies all across the world that conclude the same thing as Dan Pink just said. It seems that it is 
        important in businesses to have a wide view independent of the reward you get from it. In workplaces they use this by giving their empoloyees a day where they don't have any obligations except from doing whatever
        they want and spend their time with whatever they want but present what they did that day in a general meeting. So this makes certain teams work together on some projects made up by themselves and present it in the
        general meeting. This seems weird but as Dan Pink stated, intrinsic motivation is important here. In these 24 hours they are fully fueled by intrinsic mootivation and the results are even better than when they will
        be rewarded by a bonus or a free day off work because it widers their view instead of narrowing it by using a give-reward system.

            I partly agree and disagree with the results. The results are a huge mix and I feel like I can agree with that mix because sometimes I feel like I really want that reward and be extrinsically motivated and on the other hand I 
want myself to be intrinsically motivated and act on that. So I can agree with the fact that I am perhaps lying to myself and agree that I am partly intrinsically motivated and partly extrinsically motivated. This does not 
mean that I do not knoow what I want and that will be seen in the next chapter called Career Anchors.

        <p class = "smallHeader">Most valued</p>
        After participating in 2 different tests on 123test.nl/com I got some results of what I value the most and what I value the least. It seems like that my most valued anchor is influence/power.
        Out of a maximum of 25 points for each value I scored 24 points into influence/power which is alot. I always like to have some sort of influence inside a project or company because it gives me the feeling of having
        responsibility and that my actions have consequences which I think is great to have. I used to be the planner and the person to always contact the client inside projects and lead the course of the project to a final
        product and at the same time making sure the road to the final product is stable and no crunching is needed last moment to finish the product. The feeling of having that much influence on a project that if I screw up
        the project fails motivates me to become my best self and work really hard to not let that happen.
        My second most valued careed anchor is independency. I agree alot with this one too, I like to be the one that people depend on and not the otherway around. I don't even care that much if people depend on me but more
        that I can do the things my way and be independent from other people of saying what I have to do and when I have to do it. Ofcourse this doesn't mean I don't accept others opinions or anything, I enjoy getting criticism
        because it makes me rethink my choices and improve in different aspects. Which is why I really like working together with people in a nice ambiance and in good faith, because it can make you perform better and improve
        overall.
        <p class = "smallHeader">least valued</p>
        The career anchor that I least value is norms and values (standards). I kinda disagree with this one. If people ask something for me and I agree to do it then I will do it. Sometimes I say I won't do something if someone
        asks me to but that is most of the time because either the question is something the person can do by themself or isn't worth my time. But as an act of kindness I will do most of the things people ask me to do. Things like
        waiting for someone to go down the stairs first instead of meeting them halfway the stairs and having to let the other pass in a narrow place is normal to do. If someone is christian and follows christian norms and values,
        I may not agree with them but I won't tell them that their norms and values are bad and that they should stop with that.

     <p id="conclusion" class ="headertext">Conclusion</p>
     <div class="middletextfield">
         After doing all the research into motivation I came to the conclusion that motivation is mostly intrinsic when you really want something and extrinsic the moments you do something that is not fun or helps you personally that
         much. I find myself always switching from intrinsic to extrinsic and my motivation to do something will change accordingly. If intrinsic motivation makes people perform better and the theories are correct then I should try
         to focus more on intrinsic motivation than extrinsic.
