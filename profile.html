    <p class="headertext">Who am I?</p>

    <p class="uppertextfield">Hello! My name is Pedro Baaijens I am 18 years old. I live in Arnemuiden which is located around 20-25 minutes driving distance on a bike.
            I am known for being late everywhere. Class, work, parties etc. I live 20 meters away from my first school where I went to at the age of 5 if I am correct. <br>
            In middleschool I did VWO for 4 years untill I managed to screw up alot of my classes and ended up in HAVO year 4. I had a N+T profile which exists of Physics,
            chemistry, B level mathematics and the normal classes like languages or Physical Education but most importantly Informatica which brought me into coding and O&O 
            which learned me how to manage projects and work in groups. When I was done with middleschool I chose to do HBO-ICT.

        <p class="headertext"><br><br><br>My hobbies</p>
        <p class="middletextfield">So now you know who I am and how I ended up here. I wanna talk about my hobbies and what I do in my daily life.
        I play games since I was like 5 years old when my father played Unreal Tournament 1998 and Battlefield 1942 with me and I kept playing games from then on.
        I am in a semi-professional Rocket League team under Damage Incorporated (DI). I play literally every kind of game aslong as I can play it with friends.
        I used to play football from when I was 5 years old till I was 16 years old and played in Arnemuiden D4, E3, D2, C1, B1 and A1 (for 1 month and then I quit).
        I am practicing guitar and piano and suck at both but it's fun to do so whatever. I used to fish alot but stopped with that too. I party almost every week and I work 
        in a restaurant in Veere named Suster Anna. I worked at the Albert Heijn too for like 4 months but I hated it there so I quit. I used to repair bikes and sometimes still do.
        I train in our attic, we got some fitness equipment there and weights to keep myself fit since I don't do football anymore, I do this every other day.
