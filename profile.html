    <p class="middletextfield">Hello! My name is Pedro Baaijens I am 18 years old. I live in Arnemuiden which is located around 20-25 minutes driving distance on a bike.
            I am known for being late everywhere. Class, work, parties etc. I live 20 meters away from my first school where I went to at the age of 5 if I am correct. <br>
            In middleschool I did VWO for 4 years untill I managed to screw up alot of my classes and ended up in HAVO year 4. I had a N+T profile which exists of Physics,
            chemistry, B level mathematics and the normal classes like languages or Physical Education but most importantly Informatica which brought me into coding and O&O 
            which learned me how to manage projects and work in groups. When I was done with middleschool I chose to do HBO-ICT. I live with my parents and sister accompanied by 
            A dog and 1 cat since the other one went missing in the first week of last month so maybe I have 2 I don't know.
           
        </p>
        
        <p id="hobbies" class="headertext">My hobbies</p>
        <p class="middletextfield">So now you know who I am and how I ended up here. I wanna talk about my hobbies and what I do in my daily life.
        I play games since I was like 5 years old when my father played Unreal Tournament 1999 and Battlefield 1942 with me and I kept playing games from then on.
        I am in a semi-professional Rocket League team under <a href="https://www.dmginc.gg">Damage Incorporated (DI).</a>  I play literally every kind of game aslong as I can play it with friends.
        I used to play football from when I was 5 years old till I was 16 years old and played in Arnemuiden F4, E3, D2, C1, B1 and A1 (for 1 month and then I quit).
        I am practicing guitar and piano and suck at both but it's fun to do so whatever. I used to fish alot but stopped with that too. I party almost every week and I work 
        in a restaurant in Veere named Suster Anna. I worked at the Albert Heijn too for like 4 months but I hated it there so I quit. I used to repair bikes and sometimes still do.
        I train in our attic, we got some fitness equipment there and weights to keep myself fit since I don't do football anymore, I do this every other day.

         <p id="interest" class="headertext">
            Things I am inerested in / I like </p>
         <p class="middletextfield"> Next to my almost daily hobbies I have some interests / things I like what you hardly can call having a hobby.</p>
         <ul class="middletextfield">
            <li>Going for a walk with my dog</li>
            I got a really energetic dog that wants to play all day everyday and can't sit still unless he has to sleep.
            <li>Watching movies</li>
            Unlike people that call watching movies a hobby, I rarely watch a movie but if I do it has to be a movie with good acting and that's why I like movies from Quentin Tarantino.
            Maybe you know some of his movies, his latest was Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and his best in my opinion is either Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained.
            <li>Music</li>
            I listen to music everyday for a couple of hours and go to sleep listening to music. The main genres I listen to are Rock, Metal, Alternative, Pop, Electronic, blues and classical pieces.
            I am a huge fan of Coldplay and my favourite song from them is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKXN3KcEg6I">Death and All His Friends</a>  because of the progression and beautiful conclusion to the song. It is the ending song of the album
            Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends and I guess alot of you will know the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE">Viva La Vida.</a> Perhaps my absolute favourite song is Telegraph Road or Romeo and Juliet from Dire Straits. 
            <li>Politics</li>
            Yea I know, politics. It's for alot of people the most boring thing on earth and sometimes I agree. But I like to know what's going on in the world so I read alot about politics and
            watch alot of politics.
            <li>Following the market</li>
            I am interested in the international stock market to see what happens to companies in certain times and just before and after a release of a product to be able to guess if I should invest in a company
            or not.
            <li>Formula 1</li>
            I watch saturdays and sunday Formula 1 races if I don't have to work at the time. Even if nothing interesting happens and Mercedes is P1 and P2 again I still enjoy watching the midfield.
            Let's not talk about Ferrari.
